            <p className="aboutText">My name is Alonzo Roman, full-stack web developer and graduate of
             UC Berkeley Extension's Coding Bootcamp.
            The technical skills that I've gained from the coding bootcamp include HTML,
            Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), Javascript, jQuery, Node.js, Express,
            MySQL, Sequelize, Git, React, MongoDB, and REST APIs. My experiences in the coding
            bootcamp have prepared me and made me confident in my ability to work in
            any team environment, and my experience in the Marine Corps has given me a strong work ethic.</p>
